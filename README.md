# Poetry_Analyisis

In this project, I used computational methods to analyze poetry data. This project consists of two parts. In the first part, I worked with a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ultrajack/modern-renaissance-poetry) on Kaggle that contains approximately five-hundred poems crawled from [PoetryFoundation](https://www.poetryfoundation.org). These poems are from two time periods: Renaissance and modern; three types are included: love, nature, and mythology & folklore. Using this dataset, I aimed to explore the differences and similarities among poems categorized by three features: the ages they were written, the types or themes, and the authors. I used keywords extraction by computing word frequencies to compare poems of different ages, types, and authors. 

For the second part of the project, I worked with a significantly larger [poetry dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/johnhallman/complete-poetryfoundationorg-dataset), which contains about 15,000 poems of about 3,000 poets from poetryfoundation. I was interested in what the computer would say about poetry –– in particular, the "styles" of poets: Which poets are similar/different? What is the style of a poet? Can it imitate a poet's style to write new poems? Here, the styles are defined by its formal aspects, such as meters, rhymes, and diction. In the first section of my project, I used unsupervised learning methods to explore the similarity among poets. In the second part, I attempted to "teach" the computer to write poems with the data of a certain poet by extracting poetic features from them and using Markov Chains to generate new poems.
